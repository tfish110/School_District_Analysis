# PyCity School District Analysis
## Project Overview

Throughout this module, we worked with Maria, who guided us through building an analysis of PyCity high school data. After analyzing the data based on a number of different parameters, Maria learned of evidence that the test scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School had been tampered with. Since it would not be possible to fairly determine whether or not certain scores for specific individual students were affected, the only course of action would be to eliminate the scores for all the students in grade 9 at that school from our dataset. Maria asked that we filter out those students' data and re-run the analysis for the whole district without them.

### Resources

- Data sources: clean_students_complete.csv, schools_complete.csv
- Software: Python 3.7, Anaconda command line client 1.9.0, Conda 4.13.0, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8

## Results
### Impact on District Summary

This is the original district-level summary, before excluding the data from Thomas High School 9th graders.

![Updated_District_Summary](https://github.com/tfish110/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/district_summary_updated.png)
This is the updated district-level summary, with the Thomas High School 9th grade test scores removed from the dataset. Changes include:
- Average Math Score changed from 79.0 to 78.9
- % Passing Math changed from 75.0% to 74.8%
- % Passing Reading changed from 85.8% to 85.7%
- Overall Passing % changed from 65.2% to 64.9%
